# 🤖 SymptoTrackAI: Hybrid RAG Chatbot for Symptom Monitoring

SymptoTrackAI is an AI-powered Django web application that uses a **Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** model to provide symptom-based health advice. It combines FAISS vector search with transformer models for accurate predictions based on user-input symptoms.

## 🚀 Features

- Symptom analysis via natural language input
- Hybrid RAG architecture (retrieval + generation)
- FAISS-based similarity search
- Symptom tracking with user history
- Django-based web interface with login/registration
